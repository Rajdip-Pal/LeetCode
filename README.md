# **_LEET CODE_**

Hello Everyone,

I am a beginner in coding and currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms. Above are the LeetCode problems I have solved so far. I plan to keep adding more as I progress. I primarily use C++ for solving problems, though at times I may use other languages as well.

The solutions shared in this repository are my own, so they might not be the most efficient or optimal. I welcome any feedback or suggestions to help me improve my coding skills. If you have any questions or problems you'd like me to solve, feel free to ask—I will do my best to tackle them!

I’m not a professional coder, but I am eager to learn and improve.

Please note that some solutions might be incomplete. I apologize for that and will work on completing them as soon as I can.
